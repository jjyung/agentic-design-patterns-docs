# 09. Learning and Adaptation Pattern

## When to Use

- **Performance optimization**: When system needs to improve over time
- **User personalization**: Adapting to individual user preferences
- **Error reduction**: Learning from mistakes to prevent repetition
- **Domain specialization**: Building expertise in specific areas
- **Dynamic environments**: Adapting to changing conditions
- **Feedback incorporation**: When user corrections are available

## Where It Fits

- **Customer service**: Learning from resolved tickets and satisfaction scores
- **Content recommendation**: Adapting to user engagement patterns
- **Code assistants**: Learning from code review feedback
- **Educational systems**: Adapting to student learning patterns
- **Decision support**: Improving predictions based on outcomes

## Pros

- **Continuous improvement**: System gets better with use
- **Personalization**: Adapts to specific users or domains
- **Error reduction**: Learns to avoid past mistakes
- **Efficiency gains**: Optimizes common patterns over time
